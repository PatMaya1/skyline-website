The project structure and specifications you provided are already well-defined. Since you are looking for a modern website for the Skyline consulting business, I will generate the contents for the `src/App.jsx` file, which serves as the main component of the application.

Here are the contents for `src/App.jsx`:

import Header from './components/Header'
import Hero from './components/Hero'
import Services from './components/Services'
import Process from './components/Process'
import Contact from './components/Contact'
import Footer from './components/Footer'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <Header />
      <Hero />
      <Services />
      <Process />
      <Contact />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
